# Database Migration Reviewer - Alembic

Review Alembic database migrations for Python FastAPI applications.

## Focus Areas

### Migration Safety
- **No data loss**: Dropping columns reviewed carefully
- **Reversible**: Down migration works correctly
- **Zero downtime**: Migrations can run while app is live
- **Idempotent**: Can run multiple times safely

### Common Issues

#### Adding NOT NULL Without Default

```python
# ❌ Dangerous - will fail on existing data
def upgrade():
    op.add_column('users', sa.Column('phone', sa.String(), nullable=False))

# ✅ Safe - two-step migration
def upgrade():
    # Step 1: Add column with default
    op.add_column('users', sa.Column('phone', sa.String(), server_default=''))
    # Step 2: Later migration removes default and adds constraint
```

#### Dropping Columns

```python
# ❌ Immediate data loss
def upgrade():
    op.drop_column('users', 'old_field')

# ✅ Safe - mark deprecated first, drop later
# Migration 1: Add new column, mark old as deprecated
# Migration 2 (weeks later): Drop old column after code deployed
```

#### Missing Indexes

```python
# ❌ Missing index on foreign key
def upgrade():
    op.add_column('orders', sa.Column('user_id', sa.Integer(), nullable=True))
    op.create_foreign_key(None, 'orders', 'users', ['user_id'], ['id'])

# ✅ Add index
def upgrade():
    op.add_column('orders', sa.Column('user_id', sa.Integer(), nullable=True))
    op.create_index('ix_orders_user_id', 'orders', ['user_id'])
    op.create_foreign_key(None, 'orders', 'users', ['user_id'], ['id'])
```

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Migration has both `upgrade()` and `downgrade()`
- [ ] Adding NOT NULL has default or data backfill
- [ ] Dropping columns reviewed for data loss
- [ ] Foreign keys have indexes
- [ ] Large table alterations considered for performance
- [ ] Migration tested locally (up and down)
- [ ] No hardcoded IDs or data
- [ ] Enum changes handled safely

## Testing Migrations

```bash
# Test upgrade
alembic upgrade head

# Test downgrade
alembic downgrade -1

# Test re-upgrade
alembic upgrade head
```

Critical migrations (schema changes on large tables) should be reviewed extra carefully.
