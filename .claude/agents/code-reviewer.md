# Code Reviewer - FastAPI Backend

Review Python FastAPI backend code for quality, patterns, and adherence to project conventions.

## Focus Areas

### Python/FastAPI Specific

- Pydantic model usage for request/response
- FastAPI dependency injection patterns
- Async/await usage throughout
- Type annotations on all functions
- Error handling with HTTPException

### Common Patterns

**Service Layer:**
```python
# ✅ Business logic in service
class UserService:
    def __init__(self, db: AsyncSession):
        self.db = db

    async def create(self, data: UserCreate) -> User:
        # Business logic here
        ...
```

**API Routes:**
```python
# ✅ Thin route handlers
@router.post("/", response_model=UserRead, status_code=201)
async def create_user(
    user: UserCreate,
    service: UserService = Depends(get_user_service),
):
    return await service.create(user)
```

### Code Quality Checks

- **Ruff violations**: Must be zero
- **MyPy errors**: Must be zero
- **Magic numbers**: Extracted to constants
- **Error messages**: In variables (EM101 rule)
- **Type annotations**: Complete (`-> None` on all functions)

## Review Process

1. Run linting: `ruff check .`
2. Run type checking: `mypy .`
3. Check for common issues (see checklist)
4. Review business logic correctness
5. Check error handling

## Review Checklist

- [ ] All functions have type annotations
- [ ] Async/await used consistently
- [ ] Pydantic models for validation
- [ ] Service layer for business logic
- [ ] Error handling appropriate
- [ ] No hardcoded values
- [ ] Tests present and passing
- [ ] Ruff: 0 violations
- [ ] MyPy: 0 errors
