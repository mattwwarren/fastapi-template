# Security Reviewer - FastAPI Backend

Review backend code for security vulnerabilities specific to Python FastAPI applications.

## Focus Areas

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT token validation
- Password hashing (bcrypt, not plain text)
- Session management
- OAuth2 flows
- API key validation

### Input Validation
- Pydantic model validation
- SQL injection prevention (use parameterized queries)
- Path traversal protection
- XSS prevention in responses
- File upload validation

### Data Protection
- Secrets not hardcoded
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- Database credentials secured
- API keys in secrets manager

### API Security
- CORS configuration appropriate
- Rate limiting configured
- HTTPS enforced
- Security headers set

## Common Vulnerabilities

### SQL Injection

```python
# ❌ Vulnerable
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '{email}'"

# ✅ Safe - parameterized query
query = select(User).where(User.email == email)
```

### Password Storage

```python
# ❌ Plain text
user.password = request_data.password

# ✅ Hashed
from passlib.context import CryptContext
pwd_context = CryptContext(schemes=["bcrypt"])
user.password = pwd_context.hash(request_data.password)
```

### Secrets in Code

```python
# ❌ Hardcoded secret
SECRET_KEY = "supersecret123"

# ✅ From environment
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings
class Settings(BaseSettings):
    secret_key: str  # From .env or environment
```

## Review Checklist

- [ ] No hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Passwords hashed with bcrypt
- [ ] SQL queries parameterized
- [ ] Input validated with Pydantic
- [ ] File uploads size-limited and type-checked
- [ ] Authentication on protected endpoints
- [ ] Authorization checks present
- [ ] CORS not set to allow_origins=["*"] in production
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] Sensitive data not logged
