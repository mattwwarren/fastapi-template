"""Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) dependencies for organization permissions.

This module provides FastAPI dependencies to enforce role-based permissions within
organizations. It builds on top of tenant isolation to add fine-grained access control.

Key Security Principles:
- ROLE HIERARCHY: OWNER > ADMIN > MEMBER
- EXPLICIT PERMISSIONS: Dangerous operations require explicit role checks
- FAIL CLOSED: Missing or insufficient role returns 403

Exports:
    require_role: Factory function for role-checking dependencies
    RequireOwner: Type alias for OWNER role requirement
    RequireAdmin: Type alias for ADMIN role requirement
    RequireMember: Type alias for MEMBER role requirement

Usage:

    from fastapi_template.core.permissions import RequireAdmin, RequireOwner
    from fastapi_template.core.tenants import TenantDep

    # Require ADMIN role to add members
    @router.post("/memberships")
    async def add_member(
        session: SessionDep,
        tenant: TenantDep,
        role_check: RequireAdmin,
        payload: MembershipCreate,
    ) -> MembershipRead:
        # role_check ensures user has ADMIN or OWNER role
        ...

    # Require OWNER role to delete organization
    @router.delete("/organizations/{organization_id}")
    async def delete_org(
        organization_id: UUID,
        session: SessionDep,
        tenant: TenantDep,
        role_check: RequireOwner,
    ) -> None:
        # role_check ensures user has OWNER role
