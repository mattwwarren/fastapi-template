"""Document table for object storage with cloud provider support.

Documents are stored in object storage (local filesystem, Azure Blob Storage,
AWS S3, or Google Cloud Storage) rather than in the database.

This provides:
- Scalability: Files don't bloat the database
- Performance: Faster database queries without large binary data
- Cost efficiency: Object storage is cheaper than database storage
- Flexibility: Easy to switch between providers (local dev -> cloud production)

Migration from database storage:
    1. Update STORAGE_PROVIDER in .env (local, azure, aws_s3, gcs)
    2. Configure provider-specific settings (container/bucket, credentials)
    3. New uploads automatically use object storage
    4. Migrate existing file_data blobs to object storage with migration script

For provider setup instructions, see:
    - fastapi_template/core/storage.py (abstraction layer)
    - fastapi_template/core/storage_providers.py (implementation details)
